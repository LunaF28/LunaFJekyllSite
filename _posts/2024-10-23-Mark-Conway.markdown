## Overview

When working with Councilman Mark Conway for Baltimore City's 4th district, one of my duties was to make flyers and posters. I used Canva to make these two examples I have provided here.

## Volunteering Opportunities Poster

The above **"Volunteer Opportunities"** flyer was created because a constituent's mother emailed us asking what their child could do for volunteering. The constituent had been around the house a lot and her mother wanted to get her out and helping the community. I researched several places (listed within the poster) and created this flyer with clickable links to each volunteering opportunity.

At the bottom of the flyer, you'll find contact information for Councilman Conway, including a phone number and an email link for anyone needing help with volunteering or anything else 4th district related.

## Fourth District Town Hall Flyer

The above **"Fourth District Town Hall"** flyer was created for its namesake, the yearly 4th district town hall. Each year Councilman Conway hosts a town hall with his constituents so he can hear out their issues and bring them to the Baltimore City Council.

I again included easy ways to reach out to Councilman Conway via his social media handle ([@MarkConway4th](https://x.com/markconway4th)) or phone number (410-396-4830).
